Hello world! I am Dharshan VY, a 9ᵗʰ  grader from Tamilnadu, India. I am fascinated with AI which lead me to create this website to help young enthusiasts like me, with their AI career! This is a place where I upload blogs about AI and the projects I have created with programming languages such as python. You can also access the same resources I have used throughout in the [resources](http://www.dharshu.me/resources.html) menu at the top. Most of the codes I upload here will be python. You can mail me at the mail address at the footer of this website if you have any further queries and i'll be happy to help out!!!
