Hello world! I am Dharshan, a ninth grader from Tamil Nadu, India. I am fasicinated with AI which lead me to create this website to help young enthusiasts like me, with their AI career! This is a place where I upload blogs about AI and the projects I have created to help and inspire people like me. You can also access the same resources I have used to study programming. Most of the codes I upload here will be python. You can mail me at the mail address at the footer of this website if you have any further queries and i'll be happy to help out!!!
