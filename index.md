# **Reasons to have a website**

Before diving into the topic, lets discuss on why you should have a website of your own, regardless if you're a students like me or an entrepreneur who wants to make a name for themselves. 

FIrstly, your websites are a portfolio for you which displays your past achievements and it also expresses your unique talents and skills. Secondly, a website acts like a digital business card for a company: people can reference it again and again for things like contact information, names of employees, services offered and more. Last but not the least, your own websites can help you build credibility; having a professionally designed, thorough and easy-to-use website can help you to more easily convey to potential customers that you are a reputable organization, one they want to do business with.

# **The plethora of PROVIDERS**

There are a plethora of services (providers) that may assist you in creating your blog, but as a novice developer, I would recommend Github Pages. A professional tool that allows you to expand at your own pace while maintaining control over your postings.

# **Text Editors**

There are a whole lot of text editors out there which will help you code your way into the field of *artificial intelligence*, but what I personally use and recommend to others is [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). With support for hundreds of languages, VS Code helps you be instantly productive with syntax highlighting, bracket-matching, auto-indentation, box-selection, snippets, and more. Intuitive keyboard shortcuts, easy customization and community-contributed keyboard shortcut mappings let you navigate your code with ease.
